      <div id="overflowTest"> Mysterious white powder, a blood stain, and a moldy ham sandwich — can seem as items that are  unrelated. Although, they may be important to forensic chemists who examine raw signs and materials for answers to solve crimes. Television shows such as Dexter, CSI, and Criminal Minds, have glamorized forensic science and rendered the profession more common, so that rivalry can be high. However, if you have a deep desire to change the nature of justice by utilizing research to solve crime mysteries, then a career in forensic science may be worth exploring. </div>
