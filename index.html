        <h3 style="text-align: center;"> What is Chemistry?</h3>
      <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Chemistry is a branch of science that involves the study of the composition, structure and properties of matter. Often known as the central science, it is a creative discipline chiefly concerned with atomic and molecular structure and its change, for instance through chemical reactions.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Facts:</h3>
      <style="text-align: center;"ul>
        <li> Forensic chemistry is the application of chemistry and its subfield, forensic toxicology, in a legal setting.</li>
        <li>A forensic chemist can assist in the identification of unknown materials found at a crime scene. </li>
        <li>Specialists in this field have a wide array of methods and instruments to help identify unknown substances.</li>
        <li>Modern day detectives employ a chemical called “Luminol” to uncover evidence at a crime scene </li>

    <div id="overflowTest">Mysterious white powder, a blood stain, and a moldy ham sandwich — can seem as items that are  unrelated. Although, they may be important to forensic chemists who examine raw signs and materials for answers to solve crimes. Television shows such as Dexter, CSI, and Criminal Minds, have glamorized forensic science and rendered the profession more common, so that rivalry can be high. However, if you have a deep desire to change the nature of justice by utilizing research to solve crime mysteries, then a career in forensic science may be worth exploring. </div>
